### Hi, I'm Nicolas Riera 👋  

🎧 Front-end Developer crafting user interfaces like playlists — clean, structured, and designed to feel right.

Based in France 🇫🇷, I build modern and scalable interfaces at **LegalySpace** using **Vue.js**, **Pinia**, and **Storybook**.

I use **Cursor** daily with custom agent rules to accelerate development, reduce friction, and stay in flow.

Currently exploring **React**, front-end architecture, and always chasing better ways to build.

### 🧠 Philosophy

I believe great front-end is where **design, logic, and emotion meet**.

My background in graphic design helps me think beyond code — focusing on clarity, balance, and user experience.

I care about:

- smooth interactions  
- clean and maintainable code  
- scalable component architecture  
- developer experience

I see coding as a creative tool — somewhere between engineering and art.
